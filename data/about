	I am Romanian, born and raised in the beautiful city of 
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluj-Napoca" onclick="return ! window.open(this.href);">Cluj-Napoca</a>. 
	I graduated from the Technical University of Cluj-Napoca in 2008. Afterwards I 
	moved to Zurich, Switzerland (my current place of residence).

        I (try to) avoid the daily routine of staying in a chair at my desk by
        snowboarding in the winter, hiking in the summer, getting an adrenalie rush
        from rock climbing, or filling up memory cards with my Pentax K10.

	I also used to have a blog, at this domain, which I no longer update. A list of all the 
	articles that I wrote is <a href="http://salomie.ro/tudor/blog.html"> here </a> (with links to those articles).
